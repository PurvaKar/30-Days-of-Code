<ul>
  <li> <h4> FizzBuzz </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N.
But for multiples of 3 the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number.
For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Palindrome Integer </h4> </li>
        <p> Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

A palindrome integer is an integer x for which reverse(x) = x where reverse(x) is x with its digit reversed.
Negative numbers are not palindromic.

  <li> <h4> Power Of Two Integers </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a positive integer which fits in a 32 bit signed integer, find if it can be expressed as A^P where P > 1 and A > 0. A and P both should be integers.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Reverse integer </h4> </li>
        <p> Reverse digits of an integer. </p>
</ul>

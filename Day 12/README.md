<h1> DAY 12 </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <h4> ARRAY_BUG </h4> </li>
      <p> The following code is supposed to rotate the array A by B positions.

So, for example,

A : [1 2 3 4 5 6]

B : 1

The output :

[2 3 4 5 6 1]

However, there is a small bug in the problem. Fix the bug and submit the problem. </p>

  <li> <h4> Lists </h4> </li>
        <p> Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

1. insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
2. print: Print the list.
3. remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
4. append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
5. sort: Sort the list.
6. pop: Pop the last element from the list.
7. reverse: Reverse the list.

Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list. </p>
        
  <li> <h4> N/3 Repeat Number </h4> </li>
      <p> Youâ€™re given a read only array of n integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than n/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.

If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.

If there are multiple solutions, return any one.
</p>

  <li> <h4> Set .symmetric_difference() Operation </h4> </li>
        <p> Students of District College have subscriptions to English and French newspapers. Some students have subscribed to English only, some have subscribed to French only, and some have subscribed to both newspapers.

You are given two sets of student roll numbers. One set has subscribed to the English newspaper, and one set has subscribed to the French newspaper. Your task is to find the total number of students who have subscribed to either the English or the French newspaper but not both.
</p>

  <li> <h4> Set Mutations </h4> </li>
        <p> You are given a set A and N number of other sets. These N number of sets have to perform some specific mutation operations on set A.

Your task is to execute those operations and print the sum of elements from set A. </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Spiral Order Matrix I </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a matrix of m * n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example:

Given the following matrix:

[
    [ 1, 2, 3 ],
    [ 4, 5, 6 ],
    [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

You should return

[1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
</p>
</ul>

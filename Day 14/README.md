  <li> <h4> Matrix Search </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M and an integer B.

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for integar B in matrix A.

This matrix A has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than or equal to the last integer of the previous row.
Return 1 if B is present in A, else return 0.

Note: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Search for a Range </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a sorted array of integers A(0 based index) of size N, find the starting and ending position of a given integar B in array A.

Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].
 </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Square Root of Integer </h4> </li>
      <p> Given an integar A.

Compute and return the square root of A.

If A is not a perfect square, return floor(sqrt(A)).

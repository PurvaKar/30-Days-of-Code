<h1> DAY 15 </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <h4> Length of Last Word </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Longest Common Prefix </h4> </li>
        <p> Given the array of strings A,
you need to find the longest string S which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.

Longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1
and S2.

For Example, longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".
 </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Palindrome String </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Reverse the String </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a string A.

Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

NOTE:

1. A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.

2. Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.

3. If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

</p>

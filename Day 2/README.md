<h1> DAY 2 </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <h4> Forming a Magic Square </h4> </li>
      <p> We define a magic square to be an n x n matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2 where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.

You will be given a 3x3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1,9]. We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1,9] at cost of |a-b|. Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line. </p>

  <li> <h4> Lapindromes </h4> </li>
        <p> Lapindrome is defined as a string which when split in the middle, gives two halves having the same characters and same frequency of each character. If there are odd number of characters in the string, we ignore the middle character and check for lapindrome. For example gaga is a lapindrome, since the two halves ga and ga have the same characters with same frequency. Also, abccab, rotor and xyzxy are a few examples of lapindromes. Note that abbaab is NOT a lapindrome. The two halves contain the same characters but their frequencies do not match.

Your task is simple. Given a string, you need to tell if it is a lapindrome. </p>
  
  <li> <h4> Max Sum Contiguous Subarray </h4> </li>
      <p> Find the contiguous subarray within an array, A of length N which has the largest sum. </p>

  <li> <h4> Maximal Continuous Rest </h4> </li>
        <p> Each day in Berland consists of n hours. Polycarp likes time management. That's why he has a fixed schedule for each day — it is a sequence a1,a2,…,an (each ai is either 0 or 1), where ai=0 if Polycarp works during the i-th hour of the day and ai=1 if Polycarp rests during the i-th hour of the day.

Days go one after another endlessly and Polycarp uses the same schedule for each day.

What is the maximal number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests? It is guaranteed that there is at least one working hour in a day. </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Maximum Absolute Difference </h4> </li>
      <p> You are given an array of N integers, A1, A2 ,…, AN. Return maximum value of f(i, j) for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N.

f(i, j) is defined as |A[i] - A[j]| + |i - j|, where |x| denotes absolute value of x. </p>

  <li> <h4> Picking Numbers </h4> </li>
        <p> Given an array of integers, find and print the maximum number of integers you can select from the array such that the absolute difference between any two of the chosen integers is less than or equal to 1. For example, if your array is a=[1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5], you can create two subarrays meeting the criterion: [1,1,2,2] and [4,4,5,5,5]. The maximum length subarray has 5 elements. </p>
  
  <li> <h4> Repeat and Missing Number Array </h4> </li>
      <p> You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.
      
Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.

Return A and B.  </p>

  <li> <h4> Reverse The Number </h4> </li>
        <p> If an Integer N, write a program to reverse the given number. </p>
</ul>

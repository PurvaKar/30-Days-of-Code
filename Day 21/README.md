<h1> DAY 21 </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <h4> Reverse Bits </h4> </li>
      <p> 
	Reverse the bits of an 32 bit unsigned integer A.

Input Format:

    First and only argument of input contains an integer A
Output Format:

    return a single unsigned integer denoting minimum xor value
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Single Number II </h4> </li>
        <p> Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one which occurs once.

Find that element which does not appear thrice.

Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.

Could you implement it without using extra memory?

  <li> <h4> Single Number </h4> </li>
      <p> Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

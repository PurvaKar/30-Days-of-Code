<h1> DAY 22 </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <h4> Diffk </h4> </li>
      <p> Given an array ‘A’ of sorted integers and another non negative integer k, find if there exists 2 indices i and j such that A[i] - A[j] = k, i != j.

 Example: 
 
 Input : 
    A : [1 3 5] 
    k : 4
 
 Output : YES as 5 - 1 = 4 
 
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem

Try doing this in less than linear space complexity. </p>

  <li> <h4> Sort by Color </h4> </li>
        <p> Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue,
sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: Using library sort function is not allowed. </p>

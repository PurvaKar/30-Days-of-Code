  <li> <h4> 3 Sum </h4> </li>
      <p> Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.
Return the sum of the three integers.

Assume that there will only be one solution.

  <li> <h4> Container With Most Water </h4> </li>
        <p> Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an,
where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
'n' vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).

Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Your program should return an integer which corresponds to the maximum area of water that can be contained ( Yes, we know maximum area instead of maximum volume sounds weird. But this is 2D plane we are working with for simplicity ).

 Note: You may not slant the container. 
 </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Merge Two Sorted Lists II </h4> </li>
      <p> Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

 Note: You have to modify the array A to contain the merge of A and B. Do not output anything in your code.
TIP: C users, please malloc the result into a new array and return the result. 
If the number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively, the resulting size of array A after your code is executed should be m + n

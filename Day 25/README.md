  <li> <h4> Remove Duplicates from Sorted List </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

For example,
Given 1->1->2, return 1->2.
Given 1->1->2->3->3, return 1->2->3.
</p>

  <li> <h4> Rotated Sorted Array Search </h4> </li>
        <p> Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 ).

You are given a target value B to search. If found in the array, return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

NOTE:- Array A was sorted in non-decreasing order before rotation.

NOTE : Think about the case when there are duplicates. Does your current solution work? How does the time complexity change?*

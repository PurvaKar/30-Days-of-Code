<h1> DAY 26 </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <h4> Merge Two Sorted Lists </h4> </li>
      <p> Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list.
The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists, and should also be sorted.

For example, given following linked lists :

  A: 5 -> 8 -> 20 
  
  B: 4 -> 11 -> 15
  
The merged list should be :

4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 -> 15 -> 20
</p>

  <li> <h4> Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

For example,

Given 1->2->3->3->4->4->5, return 1->2->5.

Given 1->1->1->2->3, return 2->3.
</p>
</ul>

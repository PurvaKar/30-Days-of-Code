  <li> <h4> Remove Nth Node from List End </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

 Note:
If n is greater than the size of the list, remove the first node of the list.

Try doing it using constant additional space.
</p>

  <li> <h4> Rotate List </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.

For example:

Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL and k = 2,

return 4->5->1->2->3->NULL.
</p>
</ul>

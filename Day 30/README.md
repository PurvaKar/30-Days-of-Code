<ul>
  <li> <h4> Add Two Numbers as Lists </h4> </li>
      <p> You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)

Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

    342 + 465 = 807
Make sure there are no trailing zeros in the output list
So, 7 -> 0 -> 8 -> 0 is not a valid response even though the value is still 807.
</p>

  <li> <h4> List Cycle </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

Try solving it using constant additional space.

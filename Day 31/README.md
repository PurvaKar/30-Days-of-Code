<ul>
  <li> <h4> Nearest Smaller Element </h4> </li>
      <p> Given an array, find the nearest smaller element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array such that the element has an index smaller than i.

More formally,

    G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] such that 
    j is maximum possible AND 
    j < i AND
    A[j] < A[i]
Elements for which no smaller element exist, consider next smaller element as -1. </p>

  <li> <h4> Redundant Braces </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a string A denoting an expression. It contains the following operators ’+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’, ‘/’.

Chech whether A has redundant braces or not.

Return 1 if A has redundant braces, else return 0.

Note: A will be always a valid expression. </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Simplify Directory Path </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a string A representing an absolute path for a file (Unix-style).

Return the string A after simplifying the absolute path.

Note:

Absolute path always begin with ’/’ ( root directory ).

Path will not have whitespace characters.

<ul>
  <li> <h4> Min Stack </h4> </li>
      <p> Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) – Push element x onto stack.

pop() – Removes the element on top of the stack.

top() – Get the top element.

getMin() – Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

Note that all the operations have to be constant time operations.

  <li> <h4> Partition List </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
</p>

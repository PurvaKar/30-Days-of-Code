  <li> <h4> Anti Diagonals </h4> </li>
      <p> Give a N*N square matrix, return an array of its anti-diagonals. Look at the example for more details.

        <p> Most problems on CodeChef highlight chef's love for food and cooking but little is known about his love for racing sports. He is an avid Formula 1 fan. He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed.

Formally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long.

Count the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.

  <li> <h4> Coin Flip </h4> </li>
      <p>  Little Elephant was fond of inventing new games. After a lot of research, Little Elephant came to know that most of the animals in the forest were showing less interest to play the multi-player games.Little Elephant had started to invent single player games, and succeeded in inventing the new single player game named COIN FLIP.

In this game the player will use N coins numbered from 1 to N, and all the coins will be facing in "Same direction" (Either Head or Tail),which will be decided by the player before starting of the game.

The player needs to play N rounds.In the k-th round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to k. That is, the face of coin i will be reversed, from Head to Tail, or, from Tail to Head, for i ≤ k.

Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing N rounds. Elephant really becomes quite fond of this game COIN FLIP, so Elephant plays G times. Please help the Elephant to find out the answer.

  <li> <h4> Kth Row of Pascal's Triangle </h4> </li>
        <p> Given an index k, return the kth row of the Pascal’s triangle.

Pascal’s triangle : To generate A[C] in row R, sum up A’[C] and A’[C-1] from previous row R - 1.

  <li> <h4> Laddu </h4> </li>
        <p> You might have heard about our new goodie distribution program aka the "Laddu Accrual System". This problem is designed to give you a glimpse of its rules. You can read the page once before attempting the problem if you wish, nonetheless we will be providing all the information needed here itself.

Laddu Accrual System is our new goodie distribution program. In this program, we will be distributing Laddus in place of goodies for your winnings and various other activities (described below), that you perform on our system. Once you collect enough number of Laddus, you can then redeem them to get yourself anything from a wide range of CodeChef goodies.

Let us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.

Contest Win (CodeChef’s Long, Cook-Off, LTIME, or any contest hosted with us) : 300 + Bonus (Bonus = 20 - contest rank). Note that if your rank is > 20, then you won't get any bonus.
Top Contributor on Discuss : 300
Bug Finder : 50 - 1000 (depending on the bug severity). It may also fetch you a CodeChef internship!
Contest Hosting : 50
You can do a checkout for redeeming laddus once a month. The minimum laddus redeemable at Check Out are 200 for Indians and 400 for the rest of the world.

You are given history of various activities of a user. The user has not redeemed any of the its laddus accrued.. Now the user just wants to redeem as less amount of laddus he/she can, so that the laddus can last for as long as possible. Find out for how many maximum number of months he can redeem the laddus.

  <li> <h4> Noble Integer </h4> </li>
      <p>  Given an integer array, find if an integer p exists in the array such that the number of integers greater than p in the array equals to p
If such an integer is found return 1 else return -1.

  <li> <h4> Wormholes </h4> </li>
        <p> The year is 2102 and today is the day of ZCO. This year there are N contests and the starting and ending times of each contest is known to you. You have to participate in exactly one of these contests. Different contests may overlap. The duration of different contests might be different.


There is only one examination centre. There is a wormhole V that transports you from your house to the examination centre and another wormhole W that transports you from the examination centre back to your house. Obviously, transportation through a wormhole does not take any time; it is instantaneous. But the wormholes can be used at only certain fixed times, and these are known to you.


So, you use a V wormhole to reach the exam centre, possibly wait for some time before the next contest begins, take part in the contest, possibly wait for some more time and then use a W wormhole to return back home. If you leave through a V wormhole at time t1 and come back through a W wormhole at time t2, then the total time you have spent is (t2 - t1 + 1). Your aim is to spend as little time as possible overall while ensuring that you take part in one of the contests.


You can reach the centre exactly at the starting time of the contest, if possible. And you can leave the examination centre the very second the contest ends, if possible. You can assume that you will always be able to attend at least one contest–that is, there will always be a contest such that there is a V wormhole before it and a W wormhole after it.


For instance, suppose there are 3 contests with (start,end) times (15,21), (5,10), and (7,25), respectively. Suppose the V wormhole is available at times 4, 14, 25, 2 and the W wormhole is available at times 13 and 21. In this case, you can leave by the V wormhole at time 14, take part in the contest from time 15 to 21, and then use the W wormhole at time 21 to get back home. Therefore the time you have spent is (21 - 14 + 1) = 8. You can check that you cannot do better than this.

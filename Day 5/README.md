<h1> DAY 2 </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <h4> Beautiful Days at the Movies </h4> </li>
      <p> Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number 12, its reverse is 21. Their difference is 9. The number 120 reversed is 21, and their difference is 99.

She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

Given a range of numbered days, [i...j] and a number k, determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where |i-reverse(i)| is evenly divisible by k. If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Print the number of beautiful days in the range.

  <li> <h4> Candies </h4> </li>
        <p> Alice is a kindergarten teacher. She wants to give some candies to the children in her class.  All the children sit in a line and each of them has a rating score according to his or her performance in the class.  Alice wants to give at least 1 candy to each child. If two children sit next to each other, then the one with the higher rating must get more candies. Alice wants to minimize the total number of candies she must buy.

For example, assume her students' ratings are [4, 6, 4, 5, 6, 2]. She gives the students candy in the following minimal amounts: [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]. She must buy a minimum of 10 candies.

  <li> <h4> Greedy Florist </h4> </li>
      <p> A group of friends want to buy a bouquet of flowers. The florist wants to maximize his number of new customers and the money he makes. To do this, he decides he'll multiply the price of each flower by the number of that customer's previously purchased flowers plus 1. The first flower will be original price, (0+1) x original price, the next will be (1+1) x original price and so on.

Given the size of the group of friends, the number of flowers they want to purchase and the original prices of the flowers, determine the minimum cost to purchase all of the flowers.

  <li> <h4> Hotel Bookings Possible </h4> </li>
        <p> A hotel manager has to process N advance bookings of rooms for the next season. His hotel has K rooms. Bookings contain an arrival date and a departure date. He wants to find out whether there are enough rooms in the hotel to satisfy the demand. Write a program that solves this problem in time O(N log N).
</p>

  <li> <h4> Largest Number </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
        
Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

  <li> <h4> Lisa's Workbook </h4> </li>
      <p> Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters. Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located. The format of Lisa's book is as follows:

There are n chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from 1 to n.
The ith chapter has arr[i] problems, numbered from 1 to arr[i].
Each page can hold up to k problems. Only a chapter's last page of exercises may contain fewer than k problems.
Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.
The page number indexing starts at 1.
Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?

  <li> <h4> Sequence Equation </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a sequence of n integers, p(1),p(2),...,p(n) where each element is distinct and satisfies 1<= p(x) <=n. For each x where 1<= x <=n, find any integer y such that p(p(y))=x and print the value of y on a new line.
</p>
        
  <li> <h4> Triplets with Sum between given range </h4> </li>
      <p> Given an array of real numbers greater than zero in form of strings.
Find if there exists a triplet (a,b,c) such that 1 < a+b+c < 2 .
Return 1 for true or 0 for false.
</p>

  <li> <h4> Wave Array </h4> </li>
        <p> Given an array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array and return it,
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5.....

NOTE : If there are multiple answers possible, return the one thats lexicographically smallest.

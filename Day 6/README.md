<h1> DAY 6 </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <h4> Bigger is Greater </h4> </li>
      <p> Lexicographical order is often known as alphabetical order when dealing with strings. A string is greater than another string if it comes later in a lexicographically sorted list.

Given a word, create a new word by swapping some or all of its characters. This new word must meet two criteria:

1. It must be greater than the original word
2. It must be the smallest word that meets the first condition
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Closest Numbers </h4> </li>
        <p> Sorting is useful as the first step in many different tasks. The most common task is to make finding things easier, but there are other uses as well. In this case, it will make it easier to determine which pair or pairs of elements have the smallest absolute difference between them.
 </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Find Duplicate in Array </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a read only array of n + 1 integers between 1 and n, find one number that repeats in linear time using less than O(n) space and traversing the stream sequentially O(1) times.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Lily's Homework </h4> </li>
        <p> Whenever George asks Lily to hang out, she's busy doing homework. George wants to help her finish it faster, but he's in over his head! Can you help George understand Lily's homework so she can hang out with him?

Consider an array of n distinct integers, arr=[a[0],a[1],...,a[n-1]]. George can swap any two elements of the array any number of times. An array is beautiful if the sum of |arr[i]-arr[i-1]| among 0<i<n is minimal.

Given the array arr, determine and return the minimum number of swaps that should be performed in order to make the array beautiful.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Mars Exploration </h4> </li>
        <p> Sami's spaceship crashed on Mars! She sends a series of SOS messages to Earth for help.

Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, s, determine how many letters of Sami's SOS have been changed by radiation.

For example, Earth receives SOSTOT. Sami's original message was SOSSOS. Two of the message characters were changed in transit.
 </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Max Distance </h4> </li>
      <p> Given an array A of integers, find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].

If there is no solution possible, return -1.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Maximum Consecutive Gap </h4> </li>
        <p> Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Try to solve it in linear time/space. </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Maximum Unsorted Subarray </h4> </li>
      <p> You are given an array (zero indexed) of N non-negative integers, A0, A1 ,…, AN-1.
Find the minimum sub array Al, Al+1 ,…, Ar so if we sort(in ascending order) that sub array, then the whole array should get sorted.
If A is already sorted, output -1.
 </p>

</ul>

  <li> <h4> Bitwise AND of Numbers Range </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Find Permutation </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a positive integer n and a string s consisting only of letters D or I, you have to find any permutation of first n positive integer that satisfy the given input string.

D means the next number is smaller, while I means the next number is greater.
</p>
        
  <li> <h4> Kth Largest Element in an Array </h4> </li>
      <p> Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
</p>

  <li> <h4> Next Permutation </h4> </li>
        <p> Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the numerically next greater permutation of numbers for a given array A of size N.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must be rearranged as the lowest possible order i.e., sorted in an ascending order.
</p>

  <li> <h4> Search Insert Position </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
 </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Two Sum </h4> </li>
      <p> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
</p>

  <li> <h4> Valid Anagram </h4> </li>
        <p> Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
 </p>
</ul>

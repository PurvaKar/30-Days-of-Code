<h1> DAY 8 </h1>
<ul>
  <li> <h4> Basic Calculator II </h4> </li>
      <p> Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Count Primes </h4> </li>
        <p> Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.
 </p>
        
  <li> <h4> First Missing Integer </h4> </li>
      <p> Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.
Example:

Given [1,2,0] return 3,

[3,4,-1,1] return 2,

[-8, -7, -6] returns 1

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and use constant space.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Happy Number </h4> </li>
        <p> Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Isomorphic Strings </h4> </li>
        <p> Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.
 </p>
        
  <li> <h4> Merge Overlapping Intervals </h4> </li>
      <p> Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

For example:

Given [1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18],

return [1,6],[8,10],[15,18].

Make sure the returned intervals are sorted.
 </p>

  <li> <h4> Set Matrix Zeros </h4> </li>
        <p> Given a matrix, A of size M x N of 0s and 1s. If an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.

Note: This will be evaluated on the extra memory used. Try to minimize the space and time complexity.
</p>
